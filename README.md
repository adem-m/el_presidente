```

## Architecture

We decided to use JSON files to store all the game variables like attributes and scenario events. We also to divide the game in two big parts : 

 - The game state
 - The game loop
 
 The source code is compliant with the clean code guidelines. There was several refactoring session to be sure that the code is still clear and maintenable.
